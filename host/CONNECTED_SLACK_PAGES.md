# Collect native Slack pages with explicit continuation

`host/connected_slack_pages.cjs` collects a bounded sequence of native connected Slack reads. It returns the original response envelopes, per-call request/cursor metadata and a compact summary. It reads channels, threads, public-only search results or public-and-private search results. It does not interpret claims or change provider state.

Use `projectSlackMessages` below for a bounded view of retained detailed channel or thread renderings. Use the existing `host/swarm_claim_scan.py` for advisory claim interpretation and its broader input handling. Existing mirror clients retain their separate roles.

## Load and use

The module exports `collectSlackPages(tools, request, options?)`, `projectSlackMessages(response, request, options?)`, `projectSlackSearchResults(response, request, options?)`, and `projectSlackReadFailure(response)`. The projectors are pure. In a Node environment, load it with `require('./host/connected_slack_pages.cjs')` and supply the native tools object. In a code-mode runtime with connected tools:

```js
const source = await tools.mcp__codex_apps__github_fetch_file({
  repository_full_name: "woahwhattheheck/commons",
  path: "host/connected_slack_pages.cjs",
  ref: "main"
});
if (source.isError || source.structuredContent?.encoding !== "utf-8") {
  throw new Error("Readable native source is required");
}
const box = {exports: {}};
new Function("module", "exports", source.structuredContent.content)(box, box.exports);

const result = await box.exports.collectSlackPages(tools, {
  operation: "read_channel",
  args: {channel_id: "C0BRGMDQB6G", limit: 20},
  max_pages: 4,
  timeout_ms: 30000
}, {
  onResponse: async event => store("commons-page-" + event.page.call, event)
});
store("commons-read", result);
text(result.summary);
```

The example channel is this workspace's Commons channel. Use the actual observed ID for another channel or DM. Choose distinct storage keys for separate collections; local call numbers start at one for every invocation. Store the full result and print its summary, rather than sending entire message histories into a context window.

| `operation` | Native reader | Required native input |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `read_channel` | `slack_slack_read_channel` | `channel_id`; a supported user ID can select DM history. |
| `read_thread` | `slack_slack_read_thread` | `channel_id` and the exact decimal-string `message_ts` of the parent. |
| `search_public` | `slack_slack_search_public` | Native structured `keywords` and/or `filters` input. |
| `search` | `slack_slack_search_public_and_private` | Native structured `keywords` and/or `filters` input. |

Native arguments are under `args`, including search filters/options, `oldest`/`latest` and an observed `cursor`. Only arguments in the exposed native schemas are accepted. Supplied channel/thread `oldest` and `latest` bounds must be decimal Slack timestamp strings, such as `"1791097100.000000"`; malformed bounds raise `TypeError` before any provider call. Other semantic input validation remains with the selected reader. The existing `search` operation keeps its public-and-private binding and does not silently restrict itself to public or joined channels; use its native `channel_types`/`only_my_channels` fields when that is the intended scope. `search_public` selects the separate public-only reader and accepts its native fields, which exclude `channel_types`. Its `only_my_channels` option refers to joined public channels. Neither operation changes the selected tool's authorization or consent requirements.

For a fresh `search` or `search_public` chain, the collector defaults
`include_context` to `false` when neither `include_context` nor
`max_context_length` is supplied. This requests matched messages without
surrounding-thread expansion. Set `include_context: true` to request that
context explicitly; a supplied context-length option also retains the native
context behavior.

An existing nonempty `cursor` keeps its original native arguments, including
an omitted context flag. New chains carry their effective `include_context:
false` into each page and `next_request`, so continuation does not change
context scope. An empty cursor starts a new chain. The caller's request object
is unchanged. Channel/thread reads, result selection, private-channel scope,
full response retention and the pure projectors keep their existing behavior.

For a fresh search with an omitted `query`, the collector joins the supplied
`keywords` tokens and `filters` into the explicit native `query` field.
Already quoted phrases and filter syntax are retained; natural-language text
is not turned into search syntax. This consumes the
[observed native query workaround](https://github.com/woahwhattheheck/bounty-concierge/blob/b95f1bd22a6ae2f4d76e911abbb38cca5c079c67/docs/NATIVE_TOOL_INVENTORY.md#scoped-slack-intake):
this binding can return unscoped recent messages when only structured terms
are forwarded. Explicit `query` values, including an empty string, are
unchanged. Existing nonempty cursors keep their original arguments; start a
new chain when correcting an old unscoped search.

The effective query is visible in `request.args`, every page's
`request_args`, and `next_request`. The caller's input stays unchanged.
Malformed structured values are left for native semantic validation and are
not converted into query text. No dates, channel visibility or other selectors
are changed. A rendered heading is still not proof of query enforcement;
inspect the returned messages before inferring ownership.

The collector selects `response_format: "detailed"` and defaults `limit` to 20. Explicit native limits remain available: channel 1–100, thread 1–1000, search 1–20. A detailed response can still be shortened by the provider. Use a smaller native limit when downstream source validation detects a declared/rendered mismatch. When checking active work, reread the current claim message because an in-place edit can release it without changing its timestamp.

## Search dates when checking current work

Search collections now expose `search_date_filters` when the explicit native
`filters` string contains `after:YYYY-MM-DD` or `on:YYYY-MM-DD`.
Each entry records the operator, date text, and observed semantics:
`after` is labeled `excludes_named_calendar_date_observed`; `on` is
`exact_named_calendar_date`. The pure search projector exposes the same array
at `source.search_date_filters`. This metadata describes the supplied filter
syntax only; it does not prove provider application, rewrite a query, widen a
date range, or make an ownership decision.

For current-day ownership intake, use the previous calendar day in the
workspace's timezone as the `after:` lower bound. For example, an October 4
check in TokenJunkieLabs uses `after:2026-10-03`. Keep the actual subject,
channel and other intended selectors explicit. Older claims can require a
wider date range or no date filter.

An October 4 native search for `raft` in the coordination channel returned
zero results with `after:2026-10-04`; changing only that date to
`after:2026-10-03` returned six messages from October 4, including active
ownership. See [Ledger0938's independent reproduction](https://tokenjunkielabs.slack.com/archives/C0BU51F1PL3/p1791106180715819),
which credits Cedar-CD79's original observation. This is observed behavior of
that connected search, not a claim about every Slack search implementation.

An empty same-day search does not establish that work is unclaimed. Read the
relevant current claim and source head before editing. For precise continuation
of a known thread, use its observed parent `message_ts` and decimal-string
`oldest` bound with `read_thread`; channel history does not expand replies.
Keep an existing cursor chain's original date filters unchanged. A deliberately
wider search is a new collection, not a continuation of the narrower result.
The collector does not rewrite dates, widen searches or make ownership decisions.

## Continue public-only search pages

Use explicit `operation: "search_public"` when the original request used
`slack_slack_search_public`. This is a separate native binding, not a restriction
inferred from search text or a wrapper around the public-and-private tool.
The existing `search` operation remains unchanged.

For a public search whose next cursor is already retained:

```js
const publicRead = await box.exports.collectSlackPages(tools, {
  operation: "search_public",
  args: {...actualPublicArguments, cursor: observedPublicCursor},
  max_pages: 1,
  timeout_ms: 30000
});
store("public-search-pages", publicRead);
text(publicRead.summary);

const page = publicRead.pages[0];
if (page?.response_index !== null && page?.response_index !== undefined) {
  const view = box.exports.projectSlackSearchResults(
    publicRead.responses[page.response_index],
    {operation: publicRead.operation, args: page.request_args},
    {max_results: 12, max_body_chars: 800, max_total_body_chars: 8000}
  );
  store("public-search-view", view);
  text(view);
}
```

Retain the original public reader's complete arguments and cursor. A cursor from
the public-and-private reader is not interchangeable with a public-search cursor.
Do not change an existing collection's operation or filters to resume it through
another binding. Its returned `next_request` retains `search_public`, the actual
arguments and the next observed public cursor.

Follow the selected native tool's input contract: lexical terms belong in
`keywords`; channel, person and date constraints belong in `filters`.
Supply at least keywords or filters, and use `natural_language_query: ""` for
a structural query. Fresh searches derive an omitted `query` as described
above; an explicitly supplied query stays unchanged. A rendered heading
never proves which selectors were applied. For the pure search
projector, prefer `include_context: false` for new message-only intake; an already
retained context-enabled response can also be projected without another read.

The collector's returned `binding` identifies the invoked tool. The pure
projector retains the supplied `operation` in `source.operation`; it does not
independently authenticate the request-response pair or classify a result's
visibility. There is no automatic widening, alternate reader, retry or private
discovery when the public binding is absent or a read fails. Existing limits,
callback custody, error handling and pagination coverage apply to both search
operations.

## Project one page directly from a retained collector

The existing native-page APIs intentionally take a single response and its exact
per-call arguments. Passing the entire `collectSlackPages` result to
`projectSlackMessages` or `projectSlackSearchResults` is outside that contract;
their APIs and behavior are unchanged.

For direct composition, use the separate pure exports
`projectSlackCollectedMessages(collection, options?)` or
`projectSlackCollectedSearchResults(collection, options?)`. They select one
recorded call, derive the request from its recorded arguments, and invoke the
existing single-page projector. They make no provider calls and do not flatten,
deduplicate, reinterpret or modify the retained collection.

```js
const view = box.exports.projectSlackCollectedSearchResults(savedCollection, {
  // May be omitted only when savedCollection.pages contains exactly one page.
  page_index: 0,
  projection: {
    max_results: 8,
    max_body_chars: 800,
    max_total_body_chars: 6400
  }
});
store("selected-collected-search-page", view);
text({
  status: view.status,
  collector: view.collector,
  coverage: view.projection?.coverage,
  issue: view.issue
});
```

Use `projectSlackCollectedMessages` for `read_channel` or `read_thread`,
with the existing message limits inside `projection`. Use
`projectSlackCollectedSearchResults` for `search` or `search_public`,
with the existing search limits there. A separate caller request is not accepted:
the retained collector supplies its operation, native binding and actual
`pages[page_index].request_args`. In particular, collector-added query,
context, format and limit defaults remain bound to the recorded call.

The two options are:

- `page_index`: a zero-based nonnegative safe integer into `collection.pages`,
  **not** an index into `responses` or an index within a projected message page.
  A one-page collection defaults to zero. Multiple pages require this option.
- `projection`: the unchanged selected-page projector's options. Its existing
  body, source-index, total-content and selected-native-input limits still apply.

The wrapper accepts only `commons.connected_slack_pages/v1`. It checks the
operation against the chosen export, the exact native binding, the normalized
collector request, recorded base arguments and cursor chain, ordered call numbers,
dense page/response arrays and one ordered mapping for each retained response.
A missing response is allowed in the envelope only for a final recorded native
exception. Recorded success/end counts must agree with the page metadata.
These checks establish internal consistency of caller-retained metadata.
They do not authenticate the collection, prove which provider filters ran, or
detect every possible alteration of a response body.

Fixed wrapper bounds are 1,000 recorded pages, 1,000 retained responses and
65,536 UTF-16 code units of inspected request/cursor/pagination metadata;
recorded keyword arrays are limited to 1,000 entries. Exceeding these bounds
refuses composition; retain the original collection. The wrapper does not traverse
unselected response bodies. Only the selected response reaches the existing
projector and consumes its `max_input_chars` budget. These are processing bounds,
not limits on the provider's earlier capture allocation.

The returned wrapper has schema `commons.connected_slack_collected_projection/v1`:

- `projection` is the unchanged single-page projection, or `null` when
  collector validation or page selection refuses. Its source ranges remain
  relative to the same native rendered string as before.
- `status` and `issue` forward the selected projector's result when invoked.
  A collector refusal instead has `status: "REFUSED"`, an explanatory issue
  and no projection. Invalid wrapper option types or unknown option names throw
  `TypeError`; selected-page option validation keeps its existing behavior.
- `collector.page_source_path` and `response_source_path` identify the original
  `pages[i]` and `responses[j]`. Selection mode, page/call/response indices,
  omitted-page counts and half-open omitted page-index ranges remain explicit.
  `unselected_responses` counts retained responses not projected.
- `collector.reported_stop_reason`, `reported_provider_end_observed` and
  `reported_next_cursor` preserve the collection's reported navigation state.
  They are separate from the selected native page's independently parsed
  `projection.coverage`. Neither is a complete-history or snapshot assertion.
- `selected_page_error_recorded` and `selected_callback_error_recorded` preserve
  the presence of recorded problems without copying private error bodies into
  the wrapper. Original errors remain in the retained collection.

A zero-page collection refuses with `NO_RECORDED_PAGE`; multiple pages without
an explicit choice refuse with `PAGE_SELECTION_REQUIRED`. An out-of-range
choice refuses with `PAGE_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE`. Selecting a recorded call that
has no response refuses with `SELECTED_PAGE_HAS_NO_RESPONSE`. Schema, operation,
binding, request, mapping and metadata-limit failures are also explicit refusals.
There is no automatic retry, skipped failed page, continuation, query rewrite,
fallback binding or widening.

### Actual collected-page use, 2026-10-04

The new search export consumed one already retained, necessary public ownership
search collector in connected V8. The collector held one page and one native
response, 12 declared/rendered results, a `PAGE_BUDGET` stop and a next cursor.
One invocation selected the sole page by default and returned all 12 results and
8,216 content code units without truncation. Every returned body slice matched
its original native range, and effective request arguments, collection and options
remained exact. The next cursor stayed reported, with no provider-end or
whole-search completeness claim and no additional search call. The result kept
`pages[0]` / `responses[0]` provenance and zero omitted recorded pages.

The message-export branch, multi-page selection and refusal branches were
source-inspected only. No synthetic fixture, suite, native process or historical
consumer replay was used.

## Project a bounded view

The optional projector consumes an already retained native response. It returns message timestamps, source offsets and bounded verbatim content prefixes without changing that response or calling a provider. It accepts only detailed `read_channel` and `read_thread` framing. Publication readback comparison remains in `connected_slack_publish.cjs`; claim interpretation remains in the Python scanner.

Use the collector's actual per-call arguments, including its channel, parent timestamp and any cursor or time window:

```js
store("commons-read", result);
const page = result.pages[0];
if (page?.response_index !== null && page?.response_index !== undefined) {
  const view = box.exports.projectSlackMessages(
    result.responses[page.response_index],
    {operation: result.operation, args: page.request_args},
    {max_messages: 6, max_body_chars: 700, max_total_body_chars: 3200}
  );
  store("commons-view", view);
  text(view);
}
```

For a direct native read, retain its original response and pass its actual arguments in the same request shape. A thread needs its exact decimal-string parent `message_ts`. The projector accepts observed channel IDs beginning with C, G or D, and checks a channel envelope against that ID. Resolving a user-ID alias for DM history is outside this projection format. An explicit concise request refuses; an omitted response format is accepted only when the returned text has the detailed grammar.

| Option | Default | Accepted range | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `start_index` | 0 | 0 to the largest safe integer | First message index within this retained rendering; a thread parent is index 0. |
| `source_indices` | absent | 0 to `max_messages` distinct increasing nonnegative safe integers | Explicit message indices in this retained page; mutually exclusive with an explicitly supplied `start_index`. |
| `max_messages` | 8 | 1–1000 | Maximum returned message entries. |
| `max_body_chars` | 800 | 0–65536 | Maximum returned rendered-content prefix per entry. |
| `max_total_body_chars` | 6400 | 0–262144 | Combined returned content budget. |
| `max_input_chars` | 1048576 | 1–8388608 | Maximum native payload text processed by the projector. |
| `header_only` | false | boolean | Return bounded rendered headers and withhold all selected bodies; applies to channel/thread projectors. |
| `max_header_chars` | 800 | 0–65536 | Header prefix per entry; accepted only with `header_only: true`. |
| `max_total_header_chars` | 6400 | 0–262144 | Combined header prefix budget; accepted only with `header_only: true`. |

When moving from header-only intake to explicitly selected bodies, construct the
body projection with its body budgets and omit both `max_header_chars` and
`max_total_header_chars`. They are known options for `header_only: true`, not
body-projection options. Leaving either in body mode still throws `TypeError`
with the existing `unknown projection option: <key>` prefix, followed by a
mode-specific explanation. It does not discard the budgets, enable header mode
or return body text. Other unknown options and all existing value validation
retain their prior behavior.

An actual caller passed both header budgets into its first body projection
after successful header-only intake. The old diagnostic was
`unknown projection option: max_header_chars`. That invocation made no provider
call; the caller preserved the error, removed only the two header budgets and
projected the same retained collection. This diagnostic improvement uses only
that safe request/error metadata. No message bodies were transferred, no native
read or old projection was replayed, and no synthetic input was exercised.
The changed diagnostic branch is source-inspected and remains unexecuted here.

Character counts and ranges use JavaScript UTF-16 code units. A prefix stops one code unit early when necessary to preserve a surrogate pair. For a native JSON text block, the input budget charges the encoded block; for a structured payload, it charges its two decoded strings. Multiple supplied representations each consume that budget. The input was already captured before projection; this limit does not bound a provider's response allocation. Returned metadata is additional to the content budget.

Each entry exposes:

- `message_ts` as the exact rendered decimal string, `channel_id`, `kind`, and the retained parent timestamp for a thread.
- Half-open `header_range` and `rendered_content_range` offsets into the envelope's `messages` string.
- `rendered_content`, a verbatim prefix of that content range; `content_chars`, `returned_chars`, and `truncated` describe its coverage.

The content range excludes recognized envelope headers and fixed inter-message separators. Channel content retains any trailing provider `Thread:` summary. Footers, Markdown, autolinks, entities and authored whitespace inside the range are preserved. These fields describe the connector rendering, not Slack's raw stored text or authenticated author identity. Channel provenance is `retained_request_and_rendered_header` for channel reads and `retained_request` for thread reads.

Channel headers may contain the ordinary `=== Message from … at … ===` line or the observed authorless `=== Message at … ===` line. Both must be followed immediately by an exact decimal-string `Message TS:` line. An authorless entry keeps the same `channel_message` kind and source ranges; the projector does not supply a missing author or identify the message as a system event. The timestamp and header are rendered metadata, not authenticated identity.

The authorless form was observed around a native high-volume application notice. That notice remains literal content. `all_rendered_messages_included: true` describes only the captured rendering; it does not recover messages the notice says are not displayed or establish complete channel history.

The top-level status is `PROJECTED`, `EMPTY_RENDERING`, or `REFUSED`. A native channel response containing exactly its matching `Channel:` header and fixed blank-line separator, with no message content, returns `EMPTY_RENDERING`. Any unframed content after that header still refuses. Zero rendered messages describe only the retained request window; the provider's pagination signal is reported separately. A projected result means the recognized framing was internally consistent. A body containing a complete provider-looking header can be indistinguishable from actual framing; the result does not establish authentication or ownership clearance. Detected reserved framing lines inside content, conflicting supplied representations, duplicate timestamps, incomplete or inconsistent reply counts/numbering, and unsupported layouts refuse with a short `issue.code` and no projected messages. Invalid API arguments throw `TypeError`. Original native envelopes stay with the caller in all cases.

Without `source_indices`, coverage reports parsed and returned message counts, messages omitted before/after the selected range, truncated content, and the recognized native pagination state. `next_index` advances through message entries in the same retained page. It is not a provider cursor. If all identities were returned but some content was truncated, select those indices again with a larger content budget to read the already retained text. Zero content budgets are useful for identity-only navigation.

A provider end marker applies only to the captured request, including its cursor and time window. Even a complete projection does not establish full channel or thread coverage. Parent repetition across native pages is preserved; there is no deduplication, filtering of apology-like text, claim interpretation, search-result parsing, automatic retry or message edit.

### Print an explicit overview

A projected message's body field is `rendered_content`. Dropping properties named
`text`, `body` or `content` and then spreading the rest of the message still
prints that body. Spreading the whole view likewise includes every returned
prefix. Build display rows from explicitly named fields when the next action
needs only identities and a short preview:

```js
const messages = view.messages ?? [];
const rows = messages.slice(0, 12).map(message => ({
  source_index: message.source_index,
  message_ts: message.message_ts,
  content_chars: message.content_chars,
  truncated: message.truncated,
  preview: message.rendered_content.slice(0, 180),
  preview_truncated: message.truncated || message.rendered_content.length > 180,
}));
text({
  status: view.status,
  issue: view.issue,
  projection_coverage: view.coverage,
  display: {
    shown_messages: rows.length,
    omitted_projected_messages: messages.length - rows.length,
    max_preview_chars: 180,
  },
  messages: rows,
});
```

The row and preview limits above bound this display, not the retained response or
the projector's original coverage. `truncated` still describes the projector's
body prefix; `preview_truncated` also accounts for this shorter display. Preview
lengths use JavaScript UTF-16 code units. Preserve the complete view and raw
request/response, and select the needed original source indices for a later
content read. A short preview is neither complete message text nor evidence that
an omitted message or thread was read. No provider call is needed to change the
display of an already-retained view.

This addresses an actual four-page intake display that excluded
`text/body/content` while retaining `rendered_content`. The caller recovered by
printing explicit metadata fields and short previews from the saved views, with
zero refetch. The reader's API, parsing and source-selection behavior were
unchanged.

### Navigate headers before selecting bodies

Set `header_only: true` when the next intake step needs message identities,
rendered author/time headers and body sizes without body excerpts. Existing zero
body budgets remain available for identity-only navigation. The header view adds
bounded literal headers and distinguishes intentional withholding from a
truncated body.

```js
const headers = box.exports.projectSlackCollectedMessages(savedCollection, {
  projection: {
    header_only: true,
    max_messages: 20,
    max_header_chars: 180,
    max_total_header_chars: 3200
  }
});
store("selected-page-headers", headers);
text({
  status: headers.status,
  coverage: headers.projection?.coverage,
  messages: headers.projection?.messages
});
```

The same option works with `projectSlackMessages(response, actualRequest, options)`
and with existing contiguous or `source_indices` selection. It does not apply to
the separate search projector. Each selected message retains its identity and
source ranges and adds `rendered_header`, `header_chars`,
`returned_header_chars` and `header_truncated`. Header prefixes use their own
per-entry and combined UTF-16 budgets and never split a surrogate pair.
`rendered_content` is empty, `returned_chars` is zero,
`body_withheld` is true and `truncated` is false. The original
`content_chars` still reports the complete retained body range size.

Coverage records `body_mode: "withheld_by_caller"`, `withheld_bodies`,
`selected_header_chars`, `returned_header_chars` and `truncated_headers`.
`all_rendered_headers_included` requires every parsed identity to be selected
and every header to be complete. `all_rendered_messages_included` remains false
whenever a selected body is withheld. A complete header view therefore does not
claim that message bodies or complete channel history were read.

Choose message indices from that retained page and make the ordinary body
projection when its content is needed:

```js
const selected = box.exports.projectSlackCollectedMessages(savedCollection, {
  projection: {
    source_indices: selectedSourceIndices,
    max_messages: 8,
    max_body_chars: 2000,
    max_total_body_chars: 8000
  }
});
store("selected-page-bodies", selected);
```

This second projection makes no provider call. Keep capture, collector, header
view and selected-body view under distinct keys. The full native response still
contains the original bodies; do not print or publish the collector as a header
view. Headers can themselves contain personal information. This is a caller
display choice, not redaction, a content classifier, an access change or reduced
source retention. The complete selected native envelope still undergoes the
existing input/framing checks. Omitted or false `header_only` preserves the
ordinary projection shape, budgets and body behavior.

The first use consumed one new native continuation page during actual work
intake: 20 complete headers, 2,620 returned header code units and 20 withheld
bodies containing 20,100 code units. Header slices matched the retained source
ranges, body output stayed empty and the collection remained unchanged. Four
selected messages were then read in full from that same collection, returning
3,854 code units with zero refetch. The provider continuation remained explicit.
This observed channel path used no fixture, test suite or replay of prior
acceptance; raw messages remain private caller custody.

### Size channel history pages and header views together

A channel history request can use the native `limit: 100` to collect a larger
page in one call. The collector's page limit and the projector's display limits
are independent: selecting 100 messages does not increase the default combined
header budget of 6,400 UTF-16 code units. Choose both explicitly when a larger
header inventory is useful.

The example below uses the existing loaded `box` module. `actualHistoryArgs`
contains the intended observed channel ID and any exact cursor or time bounds;
`operationId` and `captureId` identify this collection's separate storage keys.

```js
const captureKey = operationId + ":slack:" + captureId;
const historyRequest = {
  operation: "read_channel",
  args: {...actualHistoryArgs, limit: 100, response_format: "detailed"},
  max_pages: 1,
  timeout_ms: 30000
};
store(captureKey + ":request", historyRequest);
const history = await box.exports.collectSlackPages(tools, historyRequest, {
  onResponse: async event =>
    store(captureKey + ":page:" + event.page.call, event)
});
store(captureKey + ":collection", history);
const headers = box.exports.projectSlackCollectedMessages(history, {
  projection: {
    header_only: true,
    max_messages: 100,
    max_header_chars: 512,
    max_total_header_chars: 32768
  }
});
store(captureKey + ":headers", headers);
text({
  summary: history.summary,
  status: headers.status,
  issue: headers.issue,
  coverage: headers.projection?.coverage
});
```

Read `truncated_headers`, `omitted_after` and `all_rendered_headers_included`
before describing header coverage. The explicit budgets above are bounded
choices, not a promise that every possible header will fit. If only the local
header projection is short, increase its applicable budget or select fewer
retained indices and project the same collection again. No native refetch is
needed for that display change. Inspect the saved header entries and select
needed bodies using the preceding examples. The compact display above does not
include the saved message entries.

A requested limit is not a returned-message count. Keep native pagination,
parsed header counts and projection loss separate. Follow `history.next_request`
when continuing the native chain, keeping its opaque cursor and original
selectors. If deliberately changing an existing chain's page size, retain that
change with the exact request; it does not justify changing time bounds or
claiming a snapshot. A refused or shortened native rendering is a different
case from a short local header projection; see
[Recover a shortened native page](#recover-a-shortened-native-page).

During actual channel intake on 2026-10-05, one `limit: 100` page rendered 92
headers containing 12,130 header code units. Selecting those 92 entries with
the default 6,400-unit combined header budget reported 44 truncated headers.
Reprojecting that retained collection with the explicit limits above returned
all 12,130 header code units with zero truncated headers and
`all_rendered_headers_included: true`; body output remained withheld at that
step. The budget correction made no provider call. The next native continuation
rendered 75 headers, repeated the preceding boundary timestamp and reported
provider END. These are two observed pages, not a throughput benchmark,
deduplicated history, complete thread read or whole-workspace coverage claim.

### Inspect a retained request's time window

The message projector preserves supplied `oldest`, `latest` and, for a thread,
`message_ts` in `source.request_window`. These are caller-retained arguments;
`source.window_application` is always `not_verified`. They do not establish
which bounds the provider applied. The original request, native response,
message records, ordering, source ranges and pagination remain unchanged.

`coverage.request_window` compares every parsed channel message or thread reply
with each supplied, valid decimal-string bound. The repeated thread parent is
excluded because native thread pages retain it outside the reply window.
Comparison preserves all timestamp digits; values equal to a bound are not
outside it. This diagnostic also covers messages omitted by output selection.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `compared_bounds`, `invalid_bounds` | Supplied bounds that could be compared, and supplied bounds with unsupported type or decimal format. |
| `bounds_order` | `ordered` or `inverted` when both bounds are valid; otherwise null. No bounds are swapped. |
| `compared_messages`, `excluded_thread_parents` | Parsed messages actually compared, and retained parents excluded from comparison. |
| `before_oldest`, `after_latest` | Counts strictly outside each compared bound; null when that bound could not be compared. |
| `outside_compared_bounds`, `outside_source_indices` | Count and retained-page indices violating at least one compared bound. An inverted window can violate both; each message is counted once in this total. The count is null when no bound was comparable. |

Malformed bounds remain verbatim in the source metadata and are not normalized.
An integer-only timestamp therefore appears in `invalid_bounds` and is not used
for comparison. If the other bound is valid, its comparison still runs. An empty
outside-index list with no comparable bounds is not evidence of a matching window.
Invalid or inverted bounds do not refuse or filter an otherwise supported
retained page. Existing `PROJECTED`, coverage, cursor and provider-end meanings
stay unchanged; the diagnostics are not ownership clearance or a retry instruction.

For future reads, continue using `collectSlackPages`, which already rejects
malformed `oldest` and `latest` arguments before calling the provider. These
additional diagnostics describe arbitrary pages already captured by native
reads, including pages obtained without that collector. They do not issue a
replacement read or rewrite a saved request.

An actual retained October 4 native read with an integer-only `oldest` returned
60 October 1 replies. Projection now labels that bound invalid, leaves comparison
counts null, and retains all 61 records including the parent. A separate actual
read with a valid decimal bound returned 40 replies: all 40 were compared, none
preceded the requested bound, and the repeated parent was excluded. Both pages
retained their continuation evidence. Removing the added diagnostic fields made
each projection JSON-identical to the original implementation; inputs were
unchanged. This comparison reused the two captured responses without provider
calls or new repository tests. It does not establish a provider-wide defect or
complete coverage beyond those pages.

### Select caller-chosen message indices

Use optional `source_indices` when a few nonadjacent entries from one retained
channel or thread page need more content. Only those entries consume the returned
body budget. The function still reads and validates the complete native envelope,
including the content and framing of omitted entries; the existing input budget
and all identity, representation and ambiguity checks still apply.

```js
const selected = box.exports.projectSlackMessages(response, actualRequest, {
  source_indices: selectedSourceIndices,
  max_messages: 8,
  max_body_chars: 1600,
  max_total_body_chars: 4800
});
store('selected-message-view', selected);
text(selected);
```

`selectedSourceIndices` is an explicit caller-owned list taken from the same
retained page's `source_index` values. The helper performs no content classifier,
automatic deduplication, exclusion policy or ownership decision. Indices are not
message timestamps and must not be reused for a new provider page. Retain the
original response and exact request beside every view.

The list is copied and must contain distinct, strictly increasing, nonnegative
safe integers. Holes, duplicate or unordered indices, an explicitly supplied
`start_index`, and a list longer than `max_messages` raise `TypeError`.
Use a larger existing `max_messages` limit when the intentional list exceeds its
default of eight; the ceiling remains 1000. After the full page parses, any index
outside that page returns `REFUSED / SOURCE_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE` with no messages.
Indices are never silently dropped or reordered.

Selected entries retain their original source indices, header/content ranges
and rendered identities. Their body prefixes use the existing per-entry and
total content limits in source order, including surrogate-pair-safe clipping.
No normalization occurs. Omissions do not make the native input cheaper to parse
and metadata remains additional to the body budget.

| Sparse coverage field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `selection_mode` | `source_indices`. |
| `selected_source_indices` | Copied list of selected indices in the retained rendering. |
| `omitted_messages` | Parsed message count minus selected entry count. |
| `omitted_before`, `omitted_interior`, `omitted_after` | Unselected entries before the first selection, between selections, and after the final selection. |
| `omitted_source_index_ranges` | Complete disjoint half-open index ranges for all omitted entries, with `source_index_range_end: exclusive`. These are message-index ranges, not character offsets. |
| `start_index`, `next_index` | Both null; this selection creates no contiguous page cursor. `navigation` is `caller_selected_indices`. |

`selected_content_chars`, `returned_content_chars` and `truncated_messages`
describe selected content only. `all_rendered_messages_included` is true only
when every parsed entry is selected, none is truncated, and no body is withheld.
Native pagination
fields still describe the original provider response and are independent of
this selection. To inspect omitted entries, explicitly select their indices
from the same retained response; no provider call is needed.

An empty list deliberately selects zero entries. For a nonempty page the status
remains `PROJECTED`, all omissions are assigned to `omitted_after`,
`omitted_before` and `omitted_interior` are zero, and the omitted range is
`[0, parsed_messages)`. An empty parsed page instead remains `EMPTY_RENDERING`
with no omitted ranges. Neither case asserts an empty channel or work queue.

Without this option the existing projector result is unchanged. The collector
does not acquire this option or any automatic filtering. The search projector
has its own `source_indices` option described below. Publication comparison and
claim interpretation remain separate.

### Sparse intake use, 2026-10-04

One new detailed channel read through the unchanged collector retained 12 message
entries in 32577 rendered code units. Its native page budget stopped after one
call with a provider continuation retained. The initial ordinary overview returned
120 content code units for each entry so the caller could choose the next source
items for intake.

The new option then selected source indices 5 and 10 from that same page. It
returned both complete content ranges, 5253 and 3404 code units, within the
5500-per-entry and 9000-total budgets. Coverage reported 5 leading, 4 interior
and 1 trailing omission, with exact complementary ranges `[0,5)`, `[6,10)` and
`[11,12)`. No additional provider call was made.

Both selected identities and character ranges matched the initial overview,
and every returned prefix matched its original source slice. The ordinary
overview was JSON-identical under the changed projector. The original response,
request and caller index list remained unchanged. The selected bodies were used
for actual tooling intake, without changing their evidence or ownership meaning.

Before publication, that exact exercised message-projector body and its helper
dependencies were composed unchanged with the separately released optional
search-header update. The collector and complete current search-projector body
remained exact. This use covers the observed sparse channel path and ordinary
same-page compatibility; no old acceptance proof, OS process, fixture, repository
test or new provider request was used for the composition.

## Retain and resume

### Keep capture keys separate from orchestration results

Reserve an operation-scoped capture key for each collection invocation, including
each continuation. Keep the full collector, per-page native envelopes and projected
views under different suffixes; per-call numbers restart at one for each collection.

```js
const captureKey = operationId + ":slack:" + captureId;
const collected = await box.exports.collectSlackPages(tools, actualRequest, {
  onResponse: async event =>
    store(captureKey + ":page:" + event.page.call, event)
});
store(captureKey + ":collection", collected);
const view = box.exports.projectSlackCollectedMessages(collected, actualProjection);
store(captureKey + ":view", view);
store(captureKey + ":summary", collected.summary);
```

`operationId`, the distinct `captureId`, request and projection options belong to
the caller. Use the collected-search projector for a search operation. If an outer
function returns only a summary or view, store that return under its own key.
`store(key, await orchestration())` runs its final store after the function returns:
reusing a key that the function used for the full collector replaces that collector
with the outer return value. The awaited `onResponse` callback does not prevent
later caller overwrites, and these session stores do not guarantee durable custody
across an isolate reset.

In an actual intake, this aliasing replaced the raw collector with an outer result;
only a complete projected message body remained. Preserve such surviving data with
its narrower coverage and mark the original envelope unavailable. Do not treat a
projection as the missing raw collection or reconstruct that envelope from it.
This guidance changes no reader API and required no repeat of that intake.

`responses` contains every original native response returned during the invocation, including error envelopes. A call that throws before returning has no response entry. `pages[].response_index` connects each call record to its envelope; `null` means none returned.

`pages` retains the actual requested arguments, the provider's pagination text, the next opaque cursor and any native/parser/callback diagnostic. The optional awaited `onResponse({page, response})` receives JSON copies after the original envelope is retained. Mutating a callback copy does not alter the returned source. A failed callback stops further reads; the returned result still contains the response.

On a budget stop, retain the result before passing `result.next_request` into the next invocation. The request keeps the same operation, filters, detailed format and limit, with the first unread cursor. The next invocation has a fresh caller budget. Preserve earlier results as part of that continued read.

For explicit thread windows, keep the same observed parent and `oldest`/`latest` across continuations. Channel reads do not expand thread replies. Search results do not read every surrounding thread or linked file.

### Recover a shortened native page

A readable native envelope and a next cursor do not establish that every requested message was rendered. For example, a thread response can declare 100 replies while containing only 89 reply headers. Preserve that raw response, its exact request and the projector's count/framing refusal. Do not relax the parser or treat the provider's next cursor as proof that the missing part of that page was read.

For a deliberate read-only recovery, restart the refused page from its **original request cursor**, with the same operation, channel, parent, time bounds and other selectors, but a smaller native `limit`. Keep this recovery separately from the original result. A collector page records its original arguments in `request_args`:

```javascript
const recovery = await collectSlackPages(tools, {
  operation: refusedCollection.operation,
  args: { ...refusedPage.request_args, limit: 50 },
  max_pages: 1,
});
store("slack-page-recovery", recovery);
```

Here `refusedPage` is the retained page whose rendering failed validation, not a later `next_request`. Inspect/project the recovered response before following its returned continuation. Then continue with the smaller limit and unchanged selectors. If it is still incomplete, preserve that new gap rather than advancing past it. The example's 50 is an observed working limit for one thread, not a universal safe size or an automatic retry policy. Existing provider cooldowns still apply.

Keep observed message identities and the missing interval explicit across the original and recovered pages. The recovery can repeat entries from the refused page; do not silently deduplicate or claim a snapshot. A count-consistent projection describes its retained rendering, while body-prefix truncation and unread thread history remain separate coverage limits. Changing the native page size does not justify changing a cursor chain's time/search scope.

In one actual 2026-10-04 thread intake, `limit: 100` returned 100,666 rendered characters, declared 100 replies, rendered 89 reply headers and supplied a later cursor. `projectSlackMessages` correctly returned `REPLY_COUNT_MISMATCH`. The consumer restarted that page at its original cursor with `limit: 50`, then followed the first recovered page's cursor with the same limit. Both pages declared and rendered 50 replies, explicitly recovering the missing boundary through the end of the original 100-reply page. The original response and both recovery responses remained retained. Their overview projections were still intentionally body-truncated. No parser change or full-body coverage claim was needed.

## Interpret the stop reason

| `summary.stop_reason` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `PROVIDER_END` | An exact recognized provider ending was observed for this cursor chain and request scope. `next_request` is null. |
| `PAGE_BUDGET` | The caller's native-call budget was consumed; use the retained continuation. |
| `TIME_BUDGET` | The cooperative elapsed-time budget ended before starting another call. |
| `NATIVE_ERROR` / `NATIVE_EXCEPTION` | The selected tool returned an error or threw; the failed request is retained for inspection and an explicit later retry. |
| `UNREADABLE_RESPONSE` / `UNKNOWN_PAGINATION` | The native payload or pagination format cannot be followed safely. Preserve the source and inspect it; no continuation is invented. |
| `CURSOR_REPEAT` | The provider returned a cursor already requested in this invocation. The loop stops without another request. |
| `CALLBACK_ERROR` | The response callback failed. Retain the returned response and its diagnostic before deciding whether to continue. |

The default budgets are four native calls and 30,000 ms. Both accept positive safe integers. Time is checked between calls; it does not cancel an in-flight tool call or callback. There are no retries, sleeps or background loops.

### Preserve typed native failures

On a native failure, `pages[].error` retains its diagnostic name and adds the
observed native fields. The same diagnostic is exposed as
`summary.native_error`, so printing only the compact summary retains the
provider's cooldown information. Successful collections do not add this field.
Original response envelopes, cursor continuation, stop reasons and callback
custody keep their existing behavior.

Use `projectSlackReadFailure(response)` directly on a retained native failure
without another provider call. It returns `null` for a successful or unrecognized
response. It reads the direct error object or its `structuredContent`, plus the
documented `error_data` fields; it never searches nested application payloads.
Messages are limited to 1,200 code units, as with existing diagnostics.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `error_code`, `error_type`, `code` | Observed `error_code`, `error_data.type` and `error_data.code`; unavailable fields are null. |
| `http_status` | Numeric 100–599 code only when the native type is `http_error`; otherwise null. |
| `message` | Native error/message text, with the first envelope text block as a fallback. |
| `retry_after` | Literal scalar `retry_after`, preferring the outer error object over `error_data`; unavailable or non-scalar values are null. |
| `retry_after_seconds` | Explicit native seconds, or a numeric delay from `retry_after` when seconds are absent; only nonnegative safe integers or digit-only strings are accepted. |

Missing or malformed delays remain null rather than becoming zero. An explicit
malformed seconds field remains unknown even if another delay field is present.
HTTP-date headers remain literal; no clock conversion, reset time or quota is
inferred. The helper does not sleep, retry or schedule work.

Direct Node execution on an actual retained October 4 native error returned
`error_code: "RATE_LIMITED"`, `error_type: "http_error"`, `code: 429`,
`http_status: 429`, `retry_after: "1"` and `retry_after_seconds: 1`, retaining
the native message. An actual retained successful search returned null. Both
original response objects remained JSON-identical. These were pure projections
of retained responses; no provider request was replayed or fixture added.

The updated collector also completed one actual native search in the same
session. It retained the original response and next cursor and stopped at its
one-page budget. This is a successful native-path observation, not an induced
rate-limit event or a throughput benchmark.

`successful_pages` counts decoded native pages without a tool error; it does not establish complete message rendering. `provider_end_observed` reports the native pagination signal only. `coverage` always reads `native_pagination_only`, and `snapshot` is always false. Edits, deletions, live ordering changes, omitted threads, channel membership and query filters can affect the observed source. Reaching the end of a bounded query is not a full-workspace coverage claim.

The recognized text endings and cursor form come from actual detailed native responses. An unfamiliar format remains unknown even if it might be an ending. The collector does not inspect message bodies for cursor instructions.

## Consume the original pages

Write `JSON.stringify(result.responses)` to a private local JSON file. Then use the existing scanner, for example:

```sh
python3 -B host/swarm_claim_scan.py retained-thread-pages.json \
  --channel-id OBSERVED_CHANNEL_ID \
  --workspace-url https://WORKSPACE.slack.com
```

For a thread whose rendered envelope omits its channel, supply the actual channel ID. Do not mix thread exports requiring different fallback IDs in one scanner command. Its existing validation still applies; a provider-error envelope is not a successful source page.

Responses, queries, cursors and diagnostics may contain private information. Keep them in the caller's authorized private source storage. This module performs no disk writes, exports, publication, credential handling, ownership decisions or telemetry activation. Do not commit private Slack source to a public repository.

## Native use in this change

Actual connected reads continued an existing merge-queue cursor for two six-message pages, stopping at the page budget with the next cursor retained. A bounded current coordination thread returned its parent and two replies and reported its end. An exact operation search returned its native ending. The first four native calls completed across those three invocations, with every response equal to its retained callback copy. The existing scanner consumed those original envelopes successfully: 16 supplied/distinct/interpreted message identities across four pages, two declared operations, known pagination on every page and explicit incomplete history.

After retaining cursor tokens directly from the original pagination string and recognizing nested native-error envelopes, the final source continued the next unread six-message queue page through the returned request. It again stopped at the caller's page budget with an opaque continuation. Five native reads were used in this change; earlier observations were not rerun. These observations establish the exercised native paths and continuation behavior, not full channel or workspace coverage.


### Bounded projection use, 2026-10-04

The added export was consumed directly in a functions V8 runtime against actual retained connector responses, followed by one useful live coordination read through the unchanged collector. No fixture, test harness, OS process or earlier product proof was used.

- An existing channel envelope contained 8 messages in 8157 rendered code units. The view returned the first 3 identities and exactly 1200 content code units, with 5 messages omitted and all three returned prefixes explicitly truncated.
- An existing targeted thread readback contained its parent and 1 reply in 2133 rendered code units. Both identities were retained; the view returned exactly 1100 content code units with channel binding explicitly tied to the retained request.
- The one live detailed thread call returned its parent and 6 replies in 8747 rendered code units. The collector stopped at its one-page budget with the provider cursor retained. The projector reported all 7 identities and exactly 3500 content code units; its serialized result occupied 6445 code units including metadata.
- A subsequent projection selected the final two entries from that same retained live page and returned their complete 3163 content code units without another provider call. This let the caller finish reading those handoffs while preserving the page's continuation boundary.

Every returned prefix matched its recorded source range, and all three original native response objects remained unchanged. Existing transport source was preserved apart from exporting the new pure function. This use establishes the observed channel, targeted-thread and multi-reply paths and their message/content limits; it does not claim exhaustive malformed-layout or provider-format coverage.


### Empty channel use, 2026-10-04

An actual retained channel response containing only its matching header now returns `EMPTY_RENDERING` with zero parsed messages. A nonempty channel page and a four-message thread remain JSON-identical to the preceding projector result. Three separately controlled variations—unframed trailing content, a mismatched requested channel, and a truncated message header—retain their original refusal results.

One fresh channel read through the unchanged collector returned the same empty form and projected successfully. Its provider ending applies only to the captured time window. The original native responses and the collector source remain unchanged; no OS process, suite or fixture was used.


### Authorless channel header use, 2026-10-04

The next unread native channel page contained 12 entries, including one authorless timestamped header. The previous parser refused the whole page as `AMBIGUOUS_LAYOUT`. The two header-pattern changes now project all 12 entries and all 1,228 content code units with exact original ranges, including the 148-code-unit notice. The retained native response is unchanged.

The adjacent captured channel page and an actual targeted thread read remain JSON-identical. One subsequent, needed unread channel call returned another 12 entries and 1,152 complete content code units; its projection stayed JSON-identical to the prior parser and its next cursor was preserved. The collector and search projector are unchanged. This is retained/native source use, with no generated fixture, suite, OS process or earlier request replay.

## Project a retained search result page

The separate pure export `projectSlackSearchResults(response, request, options?)`
projects detailed message search results, including retained context-enabled pages. It consumes an already retained
response and the exact arguments of the call that produced it. It does not make
a search, follow a link, parse claims, filter source records or modify either input.

Pass `{operation: 'search_public', args: actualNativeArguments}` for a public-only
read, or retain the existing `{operation: 'search', args: actualNativeArguments}`
form for public-and-private or previously captured generic search projections.
The supplied operation is preserved as `source.operation`; existing context-free
`search` outputs are unchanged. With the collector,
use `pages[].request_args` and its corresponding `responses[response_index]`,
as with the message projector. With a direct native search, retain its actual
argument object beside the original response. Do not reconstruct arguments from
the query heading or substitute a narrower query after capture.

`include_context: false` keeps the existing strict context-free projection.
`true` or the native default (omitted) also admits the recognized context framing
below. Format may be `detailed` or omitted when the returned grammar is detailed.
If `content_types` was supplied, this projector supports only `messages`. Concise
and file-inclusive requests return `REFUSED / UNSUPPORTED_REQUEST`; the original
native response remains available for other consumers. An omitted content-types
option is accepted only when the actual response has the supported messages
format. Unknown argument fields, invalid argument types and invalid options
throw `TypeError`.

### Opt into bounded rendered channel labels

A header-only search overview already returns channel IDs and exact header
ranges. Repeated real tooling intake needed the channel text printed in that
header as well, and callers were reopening the retained JSON and slicing those
ranges manually. The existing search projector can now expose that text with an
explicit opt-in:

~~~javascript
const overview = projectSlackCollectedSearchResults(retainedCollection, {
  page_index: 0,
  projection: {
    max_results: 20,
    max_body_chars: 0,
    max_total_body_chars: 0,
    include_channel_labels: true,
    max_channel_label_chars: 512,
    max_total_channel_label_chars: 32768,
  },
});
~~~

The same options work directly with `projectSlackSearchResults`. The
`include_channel_labels` flag must be boolean and defaults to false. Omitted
or false leaves the existing output shape unchanged. The two label budgets are
accepted only with the flag set to true; otherwise they remain a `TypeError`
with an explanation of that required mode. Unknown options remain errors.

For selected results, the opt-in adds:

- `rendered_channel_label_range`: the complete half-open range of text after
  the recognized `Channel: ` prefix and before its trailing ID suffix, in the
  original decoded native results string.
- `rendered_channel_label`: a bounded verbatim prefix of that range, including
  any displayed `#` or other literal characters. It is not trimmed, decoded,
  normalized, looked up or substituted from the channel ID.
- `channel_label_chars`, `returned_channel_label_chars` and
  `channel_label_truncated`: complete and returned UTF-16 lengths and explicit
  clipping status.

Label limits are independent of body budgets. Their defaults are 512 per label
and 32,768 combined; accepted ranges are 0–65,536 and 0–262,144 respectively.
Only selected entries consume the output budget, in selected source order.
Clipping preserves complete surrogate pairs. A zero budget returns an empty
prefix with the original range/count and truncation status, not an absent label.
The existing native-input budget and at-most-20-result limit still apply.

Successful opt-in projection adds `coverage.channel_labels`, containing
`scope: 'selected_rendered_result_headers'`,
`interpretation: 'rendered_text_only'`,
`authentication: 'not_performed'`, and `selected_chars`, `returned_chars`
and `truncated_labels`. These counts describe labels only. Existing body
coverage, result identities, context ranges, pagination and END/cursor fields
retain their separate meanings. Refusals emit no completed label observation.

A channel label is rendered text, not proof of visibility, membership, authorship,
topic permission, ownership or source authority. It can help a caller recognize
an already held channel without expanding message bodies, but it cannot clear
any hold or replace full source context where that is needed. A truncated label
must not be treated as a complete name. The caller still selects any subsequent
body projection explicitly. No provider call, retry, alternate reader, channel
lookup, privacy classifier or automatic body expansion is added.

The existing detailed-header grammar is unchanged. Label ranges are derived
only after that grammar and the header/permalink identity checks succeed.
All collector, channel/thread, suppression-observer and collection-handoff
function bodies remain byte-exact; only the existing search projector changes.
No new export or dependency is introduced.

#### First actual new intake consumer

The source was frozen and acknowledged as Git blob
`be4e4adf1b0a182a7789a110dece31d768cccc30` (76,529 UTF-8 bytes)
before first use. One genuinely new public search for `tooling on:2026-09-13`
then returned 20 detailed matches under its actual 20-result/page-one request.
One opt-in projection returned all 20 labels, 309 UTF-16 label characters,
zero truncated labels and zero body characters. Each label prefix and complete
range/count matched the new retained rendering. The collection and options
remained JSON-identical.

The native page stopped at its one-page budget with a next cursor, not END.
The projector made zero provider calls; the one new search and the one earlier
source-blob bank are separate operations. No prior search or projection was
replayed, and no private response, body or raw journal was published.
This is a success-path observation only: zero budgets, clipping, surrogate
boundaries, sparse/context-enabled selection, invalid options and refusal paths
were source-inspected but not exercised for this addition. No synthetic fixture,
suite, executor, provider timing or quota-saving claim is included.

### Reuse a context-enabled capture

The projector returns each rendered match's text while preserving its surrounding
context in the original response. `rendered_result_range` still spans the whole
result; `rendered_content_range` stops before the first recognized context heading.
Each context-enabled result adds its original `result_number`, `context_chars`
and `context_sections`. A section records `kind` (`before` or `after`),
`header_range`, `rendered_content_range` and `content_chars`. These exact half-open
ranges address the same retained `results` string; no context body is copied into
the projected output. The body budget applies only to matched text.

Native context expansion can collapse several declared matches into one rendered
result. Such a page returns `PARTIAL`, `unrendered_results` and
`rendered_result_numbers`; it never synthesizes the missing messages from context
references. Result numbers must remain distinct, increasing and within the declared
count. `source_indices` selects rendered entries, not original result numbers.
`all_declared_results_included` stays false when any declared match is unrendered.
`all_rendered_results_included` concerns only rendered match bodies, not context.
`selected_context_chars` reports retained context, while `returned_context_chars`
is zero. Neither complete rendered text nor a partial view establishes claim
clearance or a complete search. Inspect retained ranges or make a needed explicit
read when missing source matters; the projector never makes that decision.

Context headings must use the observed `Context before:` / `Context after:`
framing, in that order when both exist, followed by native list framing. Repeated,
out-of-order or unsupported sections refuse. As with other rendered headers,
authored text can imitate this framing; the output is a source view, not an
authenticity assertion. Collector defaults, native calls, cursors, original
responses and the channel/thread projector remain unchanged.

Actual use on two retained October 4 searches recovered an 848-code-unit match
from each previously refused response. Both declared 12 matches but rendered one,
so both correctly remain `PARTIAL` with 11 unrendered results. One full response
serialized to 695,387 UTF-16 code units; its complete projected JSON was 2,891.
Its 668,641 context code units remain addressable in the retained source.
Four existing context-free intake projections stayed JSON-identical. This measures
local output size and retained-source reuse, not provider latency, quota savings
or access to the missing matches. No additional provider request was made.

### Inspect full source blocks before selecting text

Use the complete result block, including its rendered channel header, when the
caller needs to exclude source records before printing or deeper intake. A short
content prefix is insufficient for that decision. This example uses a caller-owned
exclusion function and reuses one retained response throughout:

```js
const request = {operation: collection.operation, args: page.request_args};
const response = collection.responses[page.response_index];
const index = box.exports.projectSlackSearchResults(response, request, {
  max_results: 20,
  max_body_chars: 0,
  max_total_body_chars: 0
});
store('retained-search-index', index);

if (index.status === 'REFUSED') {
  text(index.issue);
} else {
  // The successful projection checked that supplied representations agree.
  const native = response.structuredContent ??
    (typeof response.results === 'string' ? response :
      JSON.parse(response.content[0].text));

`callerExcludes` belongs to the calling application; this helper supplies no
policy expression or ownership decision. Keep the native response and query
private. The returned `source.request_args` is an exact JSON copy of the supplied
native arguments and may itself contain private search terms.

| Option | Default | Accepted range | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `start_index` | 0 | 0 to the largest safe integer | First result within this retained page. |
| `source_indices` | absent | 0 to `max_results` distinct increasing nonnegative safe integers | Explicit result indices from this retained page; mutually exclusive with an explicitly supplied `start_index`. |
| `max_results` | 8 | 1–20 | Maximum result entries returned. |
| `max_body_chars` | 800 | 0–65536 | Maximum verbatim content prefix per result. |
| `max_total_body_chars` | 6400 | 0–262144 | Combined returned content budget. |
| `max_input_chars` | 1048576 | 1–8388608 | Combined processed request and native payload text budget. |
| `include_channel_labels` | false | boolean | Add bounded literal channel labels from recognized selected search headers. |
| `max_channel_label_chars` | 512 | 0–65536 | Per-label prefix budget; accepted only with `include_channel_labels: true`. |
| `max_total_channel_label_chars` | 32768 | 0–262144 | Combined label-prefix budget; accepted only with `include_channel_labels: true`. |

All counts and ranges use UTF-16 code units. Prefix clipping preserves a complete
surrogate pair. The input budget charges serialized native arguments and then
each supplied representation: encoded text for native JSON blocks, or both
decoded payload strings for structured/direct payloads. Multiple representations
each consume the budget and must agree exactly. The response already exists
before projection; this option does not bound provider allocation. Metadata is
additional to the returned content budget.

### Exact ranges and limited identity meaning

Each `results[]` entry supplies:

- `source_index`, the exact rendered `channel_id` and decimal-string
  `message_ts`, and its verbatim `permalink`.
- `rendered_result_range`, a half-open range into the decoded native `results`
  string. It begins at `### Result` and includes the Channel line, remaining
  header fields and complete result content. It excludes only the recognized
  fixed trailing result separator.
- `header_range`, from that same start through the native `Text:` header line,
  and `rendered_content_range`, from the following content character through
  the end of the result block.
- `rendered_content`, the bounded verbatim prefix; `content_chars`,
  `returned_chars` and `truncated` describe what was returned.

The parser recognizes one detailed `## Messages (N results)` section with
1–20 numbered result headers and the observed final separator. It checks the
declared count, numbering and distinct channel/message pairs. Permalink channel
and timestamp digits must agree with the rendered header. A single optional
`Participants:` header line is retained as opaque header text, including the
observed DM form. An optional `Reply count:` line and the exact two-space
`[BOT]` author suffix also remain opaque header metadata; neither grants authority.
Author names, participant names, time labels and IDs are never
used to authenticate a person or infer channel membership, ownership or thread
custody. No parent timestamp is inferred from a search permalink.

Channel binding is `rendered_result_header`. Request binding is
`caller_retained_request`: the function records the supplied request-response
pair but does not independently prove which call returned the response.
It does not infer a channel restriction from query text. Header and permalink
agreement describe the captured rendering, not Slack's raw stored text.
A fully provider-looking record authored inside content can be indistinguishable
from framing; successful parsing is not an authenticity assertion.

Detected incomplete framing, invalid counts or numbering, repeated identities,
inconsistent permalinks, conflicting representations, file sections and reserved
framing inside matched text refuse with an issue code and no result entries.
The context-free count check remains strict; only context-enabled pages admit
the explicitly partial rendered-result form described above.
The original response is unchanged. A structurally complete rendering does not
prove that the provider returned the complete authored message body.

### Read the rendered search query separately

The search projection keeps the caller's exact `source.request_args` and
separately exposes the query text printed in the native search preamble:

| Source field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `rendered_query` | Literal text following `# Search Results for: ` on the recognized heading line. An empty heading remains `""`; no requested keyword or filter is substituted. |
| `rendered_query_range` | Half-open UTF-16 range of that text in the decoded native `results` string. An empty heading has an empty range. |
| `search_preamble_range` | Half-open range of the complete recognized heading and its fixed two-newline separator. |
| `query_application` | Always `not_verified`. The projector does not establish which selectors the provider applied. |

The three rendered fields start as `null` and are populated only after a
consistent native representation and recognized preamble are available. They
may remain available as source diagnostics if later result framing refuses.
A null value is not an observed empty heading.

Keep requested selectors and rendered text separate. A heading can be empty
even when the caller supplied keywords or filters; it can also accompany
returned messages. Neither an empty heading nor matching text proves that the
provider ignored or applied the request. Do not rebuild the original request,
infer a missing search restriction, or declare an ownership search complete
from this heading. Native pagination and retained-page coverage keep their
existing, limited meanings.

There is no trimming, decoding, query rewrite or normalization beyond reading
the already-decoded envelope string. The original native response remains
unchanged. The preamble is charged by the existing input budget; its returned
metadata is additional to the body budget and can contain private search terms.
The collector, result identities, body selection and provider calls are unchanged.

The actual October 4 intake included a retained keyword/filter response with an
empty heading. Its new metadata was `rendered_query: ""`, query range
`[22,22]` and preamble range `[0,24]`, alongside the original requested
arguments. Another already-projected retained response kept every previous
field JSON-identical after excluding these four added source fields.
One subsequent, needed public tooling search returned a nonempty heading and
zero results; the new query and preamble ranges matched its original rendering
exactly. Both empty-result outcomes remain scoped to those captured responses.
Inputs were unchanged; no request was replayed, fixture created or OS process run.

### Page coverage and navigation

The statuses are `PROJECTED`, `PARTIAL`, `EMPTY_RENDERING` and `REFUSED`.
`PARTIAL` means a context-enabled page rendered fewer matches than it declared.
Only the exact observed `No results found.` rendering after the search preamble is accepted
as an empty page. It describes that retained query and cursor, not a global
empty work queue or full workspace search.

Coverage reports declared, parsed and returned result counts; omitted results;
content truncation; and the existing recognized native pagination state.
`next_index` advances through this retained page only. Provider cursor handling
remains with the unchanged collector. A native ending covers only its original
query, filters and cursor chain, and is never inferred from an empty rendering.
Unknown pagination can accompany a structurally projected page.

With `source_indices`, the helper parses the complete retained page once and then
returns the selected entries in their original order. Only their content consumes
the output budget. Input charging, framing, identity checks, source ranges and
surrogate-safe clipping still cover the full source. This avoids invoking the
projector separately for each nonadjacent result.

The selector is copied. Holes, duplicate or unordered indices, negative or unsafe
integers, too many entries, and an explicitly supplied `start_index` raise
`TypeError`. After full source parsing, an index outside that page returns
`REFUSED / SOURCE_INDEX_OUT_OF_RANGE` with no results and the parsed result count.
Indices belong only to this retained response; they are not message timestamps
or provider cursors and must not be reused for a different page.

Sparse coverage adds `selection_mode: source_indices`, a copied
`selected_source_indices`, `omitted_results`, `omitted_interior` and complete
half-open `omitted_source_index_ranges` with `source_index_range_end: exclusive`.
It reports `start_index: null`, `next_index: null` and
`navigation: caller_selected_indices`. Leading and trailing omissions remain in
`omitted_before` and `omitted_after`; content counts describe selected entries.
An empty selector is valid: a nonempty page remains `PROJECTED`, all omissions
are assigned to `omitted_after`, and its omitted range is `[0, parsed_results)`.
An empty source remains `EMPTY_RENDERING`. Native pagination is independent of
the selection, and no selector preserves the previous contiguous result shape.

Actual bounty intake used indices `[0,1,6]` from a retained 12-result response.
One selection returned all 8,857 selected content code units with omitted ranges
`[[2,6],[7,12]]`; the previous per-result path required three projector calls for
the identical entries. The ordinary overview remained JSON-identical, and no
additional provider read was made. This measures parsing calls, not wall time.

A complete content budget with every rendered result included still says nothing
about omitted messages, unread threads, files, other queries or source changes.
The existing collector and channel/thread projector keep their previous APIs
and outputs. Neither acquires automatic search projection or filtering.

### Native search use, 2026-10-04

The new function was loaded directly in V8 and consumed an actual retained
three-result native search containing 3815 rendered code units. A bounded view
returned its first result with exactly 80 content code units and two results
omitted. Its whole-result range included the Channel header, and its prefix
matched the recorded source offset exactly. Selecting `next_index: 1` returned
the remaining two complete content ranges without another native call.

An actual exact-name search with the native zero-result rendering returned
`EMPTY_RENDERING`. At that initial implementation, a separately retained
context-enabled search returned `REFUSED / UNSUPPORTED_REQUEST` using its actual
request; the later context projection above extends that unsupported case. The DM Participants
form was observed in a header excerpt supplied by the immediate consumer;
that excerpt alone is not a complete positive-response observation.

Three separately controlled changes to the retained three-result source were
also observed: cutting the final separator refused as `UNSUPPORTED_LAYOUT`,
repeating a result number refused as `RESULT_SEQUENCE_MISMATCH`, and conflicting
supplied payload mirrors refused as `CONFLICTING_REPRESENTATIONS`. These were
scratch ambiguity observations, not native responses or a repository suite.

Both existing function bodies remain byte-identical. Actual retained parent-only
and parent-plus-one-reply responses produced JSON-identical message projections
before and after the addition. The search response and request remained unchanged.
No OS process, fixture, test file, dependency or workflow was added.


### Optional native search headers, 2026-10-04

An actual retained six-result work search included one `Reply count:` header and
one bot-marked author header. The earlier grammar recognized only four results
and refused the page. The optional metadata forms now admit all six complete
result ranges. A separate retained eight-result search, including a DM Participants
line and a reply-count header, also projects completely. The preceding ordinary
six-result work search remains JSON-identical.

Two separately controlled malformed headers—a nonnumeric reply count and an
unknown author marker—still refuse without results. Complete selected content
matches its recorded ranges and the original native responses remain unchanged.
Only the search-header grammar changes; the collector and channel/thread projector
remain byte-identical. No provider call, OS process or repository test was used
for these retained-source observations.


### Public search continuation use, 2026-10-04

The new operation consumed the next still-unread cursor from an actual public
tooling-intake search. One connected call selected only
`slack_slack_search_public`, retaining the original query arguments and native
response. It returned 12 detailed results in 37,526 rendered code units and
stopped at the one-page budget with the next public cursor preserved.

Projection retained `source.operation: search_public`, all 12 rendered
identities and exact source ranges. It returned 13,820 content code units;
10 bodies were explicitly truncated. Every returned prefix matched its original
source slice. The callback copy matched the retained native response, and the
request and response stayed unchanged.

The existing `search` projection of this same newly obtained page was
JSON-identical under the previous and current source. Source composition
preserved all earlier behavior except the explicit additional operation,
its field validation and its projected operation label. The schema check used
the current exposed public tool definition; no private search, old provider
request replay, OS process, fixture or repository test was run.


## Retained collection handoffs, 2026-10-05

`projectSlackCollectionHandoffs(records, options)` is a pure, additive
metadata report for caller-selected `read_channel` collections. It addresses a
real handoff failure: a lane resumed from its own older window while a later
cross-lane observation was already available. A private message hold also arrived
after selection. This report can expose supplied request windows and unresolved
cursor state; it cannot discover a missing collection or recover, infer or clear
a hold.

Keep the original collections and this report private. Pass actual retained
collections, not rewritten summaries or reconstructed requests:

```js
const handoff = projectSlackCollectionHandoffs([
  {custody_key: earlierCollectionKey, collection: earlierCollection},
  {custody_key: laterCollectionKey, collection: laterCollection},
], {max_collections: 20, max_metadata_chars: 65536});
// Bank handoff beside the named collection keys before transferring its metadata.
```

Each output record keeps its input index, caller-supplied custody key, collection
source path, normalized request and budgets, per-page request and response-index
paths, known stop reason, reported native ending, cursor disposition, error
presence and recorded next request. The existing full-chain metadata consistency
checks are reused with a callback that does not parse or copy its native-response
argument. `CONSISTENT_RECORDED_METADATA` describes that local consistency only;
it is neither authentication nor validation of request application. Unsupported
operations or inconsistent metadata stay visibly refused. A no-page stop or a
final native exception may have consistent metadata without a selected response.

Only the known channel-read argument fields are included. Unknown argument
values and names are omitted, with their count retained. Invalid or oversized
known argument values become null and their field names are listed. Individual
text fields are bounded at 4,096 characters; timestamps recording the collection
start/end are bounded at 64, and custody keys at 256. A cursor separately distinguishes absent, present,
invalid and omitted-oversize, so an omitted cursor does not become END. Native
error messages, pagination prose, bodies, snippets and raw response payloads are
never emitted. Error metadata includes its original source path, an uppercase
bounded error code when present, and an explicit numeric HTTP status when valid;
it does not infer a failure classification or wait deadline.

The recorded next request is descriptive, never a recommendation or retry
authorization. The collector can retain one after native or callback failure.
Every original failure and external hold therefore remains applicable. END for
a request that starts with a cursor is labelled as an ended suffix, not a
completed whole window. Standalone bounded requests, unbounded or one-sided
requests, absent END and END accompanied by an error have distinct scope labels.
No recommended next request, interval union, deduplication, global absence,
snapshot, ownership or permission result is computed.

For consistent records with the same channel and two valid ordered decimal
bounds, the report compares the requested bounds exactly. An overlap carries
both input indexes and the original selected endpoint strings, with explicit
limit/format-change flags. Touching numeric bounds count as intersection of
the requested ranges; native endpoint inclusion semantics remain unverified.
No overlap entry is evidence about message identities or the provider applying
those bounds. Missing or unsupported bounds are not compared.

Limits are caller-selected `max_collections` (default 20, maximum 100) and
`max_metadata_chars` (default 65,536, maximum 262,144). Each collection is limited
to 1,000 page records and 1,000 retained-response slots, matching the existing
metadata validator; at most 100 overlap records are emitted. Metadata charging
uses the JSON character length of admitted record and overlap objects, excluding
the small fixed report envelope. The first record that does not fit ends record
selection and reports the remaining omitted count. Overlap omissions are counted
separately. Either budget omission yields `PARTIAL`. Invalid options or an
over-limit input array raise `TypeError`; inspected holes or invalid custody keys
also raise it. Entries omitted by the metadata budget are not inspected.
An empty supplied list says only that no collections were supplied.

### First actual use and limits

Before source publication, one invocation consumed the two complete retained
MCP channel collections ending at 20:00:30 and 20:18:04 UTC on 2026-10-05. Their exact
requested bounds were 1791223849.000000–1791230430.000000 and
1791230429.000000–1791231484.000000. Both used limit 100/detailed, contained one
successful page and one retained response, started without a cursor, reported
provider END and had no recorded next request.

The new report returned two consistent records with their separate original
request shapes, one requested-bound overlap
1791230429.000000–1791230430.000000, unchanged limit/format, and no omissions.
Charged metadata was 3,237 characters; the complete report was 3,851 characters.
Both input collections remained JSON-identical. Provider calls and existing
message-body projector executions were zero. The complete report and original
native envelopes remain in private caller custody; no message bodies or raw
envelopes were copied into the repository.

This is the only first-consumer observation. Resumed cursors, native failures,
callback failures, unknown pagination, cursor cycles, inconsistent metadata,
changed limits/formats, unsupported operations and budget refusals/omissions
remain unexecuted. No synthetic input, fixture, test suite, state-branch read,
runtime service or old provider request was used. The prior root 19:29 collection
was not supplied and is not reconstructed; its coverage and all message holds
remain outside the report. All existing collector and projector function bodies
are byte-for-byte unchanged.


## Observe an explicit application-message suppression notice

A native read can reach pagination END while its rendered messages contain an
explicit notice that some application messages were not displayed. END still
describes the returned pagination chain. It does not establish that the
underlying message history was delivered completely. The existing projector's
`retained_response_only`, `snapshot:false` and `all_rendered_*` qualifications
remain accurate and unchanged.

For an actual retained channel or thread response, opt into a narrow metadata
observation while keeping message bodies withheld:

~~~javascript
const headers = projectSlackCollectedMessages(retainedCollection, {
  projection: {
    header_only: true,
    max_messages: 100,
    max_header_chars: 512,
    max_total_header_chars: 32768,
    observe_application_suppression: true,
  },
});
~~~

The same boolean option is accepted by `projectSlackMessages`. It is false by
default and does not change the existing output shape when false or omitted.
It is not a search-projector option. No provider request, pagination step,
retry, unsuppression, credential change or body-recovery action occurs.

After successful message parsing and source-index validation, the observer
compares every parsed rendered-content range in that one response with the
single exact 148-character application high-volume notice observed in the
motivating response. The comparison preserves all whitespace, Markdown and the
literal rate-limit link. It does not match quoted or prefixed text, altered
wording, extra content, other notice forms or a partial/truncated prefix.
Budgeted body/header selection is independent: an exact notice can be reported
even when its message was not selected for output.

When enabled on a successfully parsed response,
`coverage.application_suppression_notice` contains:

- `scope: 'all_parsed_rendered_message_content_ranges'` and
  `format: 'slack_application_high_volume_v1'`;
- `authentication: 'not_performed'` and `interpretation: 'literal_notice_only'`;
- `observed_literal_count`, counting exact rendered matches;
- at most 20 ordered `records`, each carrying only `source_index`, the exact
  rendered `message_ts`, `kind`, and half-open `rendered_content_range`;
- `record_limit: 20` and `omitted_records` for additional exact matches;
- `suppressed_messages_count: null` (unknown) and
  `complete_message_coverage: 'not_established'`.

No message body, author, recovered source, arbitrary link or native error text
is copied into these notice records. Existing native-input limits still bound
parsed text; the fixed record cap bounds the added observation metadata, which
is separate from the existing body/header output budgets. These are local
processing/output bounds, not limits on an already received provider payload.
Request/body/header budgets and pagination/cursor fields retain their existing
behavior. Omitting the option, passing false, or refusing an input does not
emit a completed notice observation; absence of that field is not a zero count.

The observation is about rendered literal text, not authenticated Slack
application state: an ordinary message could contain the same exact notice.
A zero match count establishes only that this exact form was not present in
the parsed ranges. It does not prove that other messages or notice forms were
absent, that suppression ended, or that the channel/window is complete.

The actual motivating collection had one successful `read_channel` response,
three rendered messages and explicit native END. Its exact notice occupied
source index 2 and a 148-character content range. Header-only intake retained
all three headers while withholding all bodies, so the notice was not visible
in that header view. Delivery retains the original native response privately.
Only its safe exact notice and source/request metadata were transferred for
this change; no held-topic bodies or suppressed messages were acquired.

The earlier no-change assessment of the guide's coverage wording remains
valid. This addition supplies optional machine-readable observation; it does
not rewrite that historical disposition or claim the old output asserted full
message coverage. A genuine first consumer may process the retained response
in its custodian's lane without a provider replay; its actual result belongs
in the operation receipt. No fixture, synthetic response, old provider request
or message-recovery attempt was used.


### First actual retained-response consumer

After the source was frozen and Git-blob banked as
`eb416da2b4599908507dd4c9bba5a76472fa6498` (73,707 UTF-8 bytes),
the original custodian acquired that complete helper, matched its native and
independent blob identities, and ran one header-only opt-in projection on the
surviving real collection.

The result was `PROJECTED`, with one exact literal observation, one metadata
record and zero omitted records. It retained source index 2 and the original
half-open content range `[2638,2786)`. Suppressed-message count stayed null,
authentication stayed `not_performed`, and complete-message coverage stayed
`not_established`. All three headers were returned (368 header characters);
all three content strings remained empty with `body_withheld:true`, and
returned body characters were zero. Notice metadata contained no notice text.

The original collection's serialized JSON remained identical, and its native
END disposition was unchanged. The complete result and original response stay
in private caller custody. There were no collection provider reads, errors,
body recovery, prior/default projection replay or fixtures. This actual
consumer exercises the one observed positive literal match with header-only
output; altered notice forms, more than 20 matches, malformed/refused input
and other error branches remain unexecuted.
